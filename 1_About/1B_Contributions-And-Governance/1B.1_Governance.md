# DITAP Program Governance

The Digital IT Training Professional Program operates through a collaborative consortium model that brings together federal agencies, certified vendors, and program alumni to continuously improve digital acquisition training for government professionals.

## Ownership and Oversight

### Who Owns the Project

1. **Legal Responsibility:** United States Digital Service (USDS) leads the DITAP Program. Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) issues certifications to graduates.  
2. **How Ownership is Expressed:**  
   * USDS funded the 2024-2025 curriculum refresh  
   * USDS initiated and chairs the DITAP Consortium  
   * USDS provides strategic direction and resource management

## Feedback Mechanisms

* **Vendor Feedback:** facilitator insights, and learner outcome data  
* **Alumni Input:** Post-training surveys, and ongoing community engagement  
* **Public Engagement:** Open GitHub repository for community contributions 

Regular strategic reviews by Consortium members align curriculum updates with government priorities and vendor capacity.

## Sustainability 

**Future-Proofing:** Open-source model enables community contributions and reduces single-vendor dependence. GitHub hosting ensures long-term accessibility and version control.

**Maintenance:** Consortium model distributes maintenance responsibilities across stakeholders. 

**Environmental Considerations:** Digital-first approach minimizes physical materials. Virtual delivery options reduce travel requirements for training delivery.
