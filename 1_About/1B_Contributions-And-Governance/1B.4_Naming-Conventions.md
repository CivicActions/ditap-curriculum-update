# Naming Conventions

Consistent naming conventions make it easier for individuals to utilize the repository and contribute.
The following guidelines establish a standard approach to naming files in this resource to maintain clarity and ease of use.

## 1. General Principles
- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Keep names concise, avoiding unnecessary words or symbols. Repository names should clearly describe the purpose or contents of the project as simply as possible.
- **Consistency**: Apply the same patterns across all repositories to reduce confusion.
- **Searchability**: Choose words that make the repository easy to find through search.

## 2. Formatting Rules
- **Title Case**: Files should be formatted with the first letter capitalized such as "File Name.md" or "File-Name.md"
- **Intentional File Order**: If the file order within a folder is considered important to preserve, files should be named with an initial number such as "1_File-Name.md", "2_File-Name.md", etc.
  - If the file numbers go above ten, utilize two characters such as "01_File-Name.md, ..., 10_File-Name.md".
  - If utilizing a specific order within files, you may also utilize a letter such as "1_Folder, 1A_Subfolder, etc.".
- **Keep It Short**: Aim for fewer than 30 characters when possible.
