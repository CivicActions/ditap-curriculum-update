3. **Supporting Teams:** Program leadership (USDS, FAI, OFPP), certified vendor network, agency subject matter experts, and alumni

## Feedback

* **Vendor Feedback:** facilitator insights, and learner outcome data  
* **Alumni Input:** Post-training surveys, and ongoing community engagement  
* **Public Engagement:** Open GitHub repository for community contributions 

Regular strategic reviews by Consortium members align curriculum updates with government priorities and vendor capacity.

## Compliance Frameworks

* Section 508 compliance: specific to current federal requirements  
* Privacy: Federal data handling standards for learner information  
* Security: GitHub security protocols

## Sustainability 

**Future-Proofing:** Open-source model enables community contributions and reduces single-vendor dependence. GitHub hosting ensures long-term accessibility and version control.

**Maintenance:** Consortium model distributes maintenance responsibilities across stakeholders. 

**Environmental Considerations:** Digital-first approach minimizes physical materials. Virtual delivery options reduce travel requirements for training delivery.
