# About these documents

The purpose of these documents is to document how key governance issues are addressed by the DITAP Refresh project  to ensure smooth project orientation and working communications.

The areas covered by these artifacts are consonant with ISO/IEC 38500:2024.

##How to use these documents

These documents are intended to guide decisions about how to communicate to interested parties about your project/product. The most critical pieces are the first three templates: Purpose and Scope, Impact and Metrics, and Governance. These artifacts should be completed by each project. The remaining artifacts may be useful for larger, more dynamic projects that have larger, more active user and developer bases, and are intended to clarify details surrounding how the project is run, how it is managed, and how other people can contribute to the project.

It is important to note that the intention of these artifacts is to prompt thought and discussion around each of the issue areas. It is not critical that each issue be filled out/completed (that is not often possible at the beginning of open-source initiatives). Rather, it is meant to prompt thought and attention to issues that become increasingly more important as an initiative becomes successful (and therefore, a target).

# Accessibility Statement

## Overview

This repository contains Digital IT Acquisition Professional Training Program (DITAP) materials for learning. These materials include HTML, Markdown, PDF files, and documents from Microsoft Office and Google Workspace. Some of the content originates from teams outside the DITAP Curriculum Update Team. Contributed material may not follow DITAP accessiblity standards mentioned below, but the Curriculum Update Team will improve older or contributed content when possible.

## Target

## Accessibility Standards Target

We want our content to follow **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA.** These guidelines are a best practice and go beyond what is required by this contract. Meeting this standard will make the content easier to use and will last longer.

If meeting WCAG 2.2 AA standards is not possible, we will follow WCAG 2.0 AA. We will focus on making new documents accessible first and will only update older or contributed content if there is enough time.

## Automated Testing

We recommend using automated tools to check for accessibility issues. These tools do not catch everything, but they help create a strong foundation. Tools like **Pa11y** and **Textlint** can fix common problems. Setting up a good CI/CD pipeline will help stop errors before they get added to the repository.

## Plain Language

Writing in plain language is important for accessibility. We encourage authors to visit [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) to learn about best practices. Tools like [HemingwayApp](https://hemingwayapp.com/)  can help identify overly complex sentences, unwieldy grammar, and can identify what grade-level the content appeals to. We suggest checking content both manually and with plain-language evaluation tools. We aim for a Grade 8 reading level. Even though our audience is highly educated, everyone understands information better when it is clear and simple.

## Document Testing

Authors should the tools available to them to check document accessibility. [Visit Section508.gov for tips](https://www.section508.gov/create/). Use the built-in accessibility checker in Microsoft Office to catch problems. For Google Workspace documents, use **GrackleDoc** to find similar issues.

Authors should also make documents easy to follow. Use slides with one heading and one main point. These are easier to read than slides with too much content.

If we publish a document as a PDF, we will also include an editable version in Microsoft Office. This will make it easier to update and improve the document in the future.

## Legacy and Contributed Content

The repository includes older and contributed materials. These materials are useful for students, but they may not meet accessibility standards.

## Feedback

We want feedback from users, educators, and developers. If you see a problem with accessibility, please tell us. You can [report issues in our issue queue](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/issues). Your feedback helps us improve.
