## Introduction

We're so thankful you're considering contributing to an [open source project of
the U.S. government](https://code.gov/)! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all friendly
contributions.

Anyone can contribute to this project by submitting ideas for course materials to this repository. Keep in mind that anything submitted to this project must be licensed to be in the public domain.

# Contribution Workflow

## Add an Issue to the project backlog

The first step to submitting or editing an existing artifact is to create an issue or big ticket describing the problem you are  attempting to solve, and providing details on how you want to address the issue. 

Be clear about describing the problem you are attempting to address, how you plan to address it, and include a link to the pull request related to the ticket.  

By documenting the problem and proposed solution, you are beginning to create critical documentation for the feature or artifact you are submitting. It's important that as  you are writing your ticket description that you use plain language and speak to as broad an audience as is reasonable for the problem you are addressing.

### Bug reporting

If your issue is a bug, please use this format to describe the issue so that the problem can be validated by other contributors:

------

#### Describe the observed behavior

As concisely as possible, describe the observed behavior, starting with the URL where the problem occurs/exists, any roles/permission access required to access the URL, then list step by step how to replicate the problem.

#### Describe the behavior you expected

As concisely as possible, describe the behavior you expected to occur.

------



##Code Workflow and Branching

If  you would like to submit materials for inclusion in this repository, we follow the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). The basic workflow is to:

1.  Fork the project
2.  Check out the `main` branch
3.  Create a feature branch whose name starts with the issue ID of the ticket documenting the need for your submission.
4.  Write code and (and any tests needed) for your change
5.  From your branch, make a pull request against `usds/ditap-curriculum-update/main`
6.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
7.  Wait for your change to be pulled into ``usds/ditap-curriculum-update/main``
8.  Delete your feature branch



### Pull Requests

Comments should be formatted to a width no greater than 80 columns.

Files should be exempt of trailing spaces.

We adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit
messages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80
columns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).

**One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)**

**Problem**

Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem
you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be
thought of being the motivation for your change.

**Solution**

Describe the modifications you've done.

**Result**

What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this
section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.

Some important notes regarding the summary line:

* Describe what was done; not the result

* Use the active voice

* Use the present tense

* Capitalize properly

* Do not end in a period — this is a title/subject

* Prefix the subject with its scope

  

## Reviewing Pull Requests

When you submit a pull request on GitHub, it will be reviewed by the project
community, and once the changes are approved, your commits will be brought into
a development branch for additional testing. Once the changes are merged, they will
be pushed back to the main branch.

If the issue the pull request is addressing is particularly urgent, the pull request
will be merged directly into the main branch.

# Contributor's Code of Conduct

These guidelines below apply to anyone contributing to the DITAP project and interacting with other community members on communication channels such as mailing lists, learning portal, Slack, Zoom, email, and discussion boards.

- **Accounts and Names:** Pseudonyms and real names are both allowed
- **Be Kind:** Being welcoming to new community members is everyone’s responsibility. Show empathy; use welcoming and inclusive language. Critique is encouraged; being mean is not.
- **Be On-Topic:** Posts and comments in the Zoom chat should contribute to the discussion. Start new discussions rather than derailing existing ones.
- **Be Respectful:** Do not distribute sexually explicit material. Keep swearing to a minimum. Be sensitive to the expectations of a global audience.
- **Be Legal:** Comply with and do not violate United States law (or other applicable law or legal obligations) and encourage others to do the same.
- **Respect Privacy**: Respect the privacy of others. Do not distribute private, confidential, or proprietary correspondence or information without permission.
- **Minimize Promotion:** Attributing credit, thanking other contributors, and mentioning one’s company are allowed. Direct promotion or advertisement are not, except in specific venues.
- **Report Upward:** Please inform the appropriate DITAP facilitators of your discussion venue if you see a violation of the rules. Handling it yourself is more likely to start an argument, and makes it harder for the community manager to track repeat offenders.
- **Respect the Moderators:** Do not argue publicly or privately with moderators about their actions. It’s not good for the classroom and DITAP community in any way. If you have trouble with what one moderator has said to you, bring it up with another moderator, or with the cohort point of contact from your agency. 

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the course and community 
- Showing empathy towards other cohort and community members
