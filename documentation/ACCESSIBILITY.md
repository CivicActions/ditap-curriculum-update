# Accessibility Statement

## Overview

This repository contains materials for learning. These materials include HTML, Markdown, PDF files, and documents from Microsoft Office and Google Workspace. Some of the content comes from teams outside the DITAP Curriculum Update contract. We welcome contributions from others, but not all of their content will be accessible. The Curriculum Update team will improve older or contributed content when possible.

## Target

We want our content to follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA. These guidelines are a best practice and go beyond what is required by this contract. Meeting this standard will make the content easier to use and last longer. If WCAG 2.2 AA is not possible, we will follow WCAG 2.0 AA. We will focus on making new documents accessible first. We will only update older or contributed content if there is enough time.

## Automated Testing

We recommend using automated tools to check for accessibility issues. These tools do not catch everything, but they help create a strong foundation. Tools like Pa11y and Textlint can fix common problems. Setting up a good CI/CD pipeline will help stop errors before they get added to the repository.

## Plain Language

Writing in plain language is important. We encourage authors to visit [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) to learn about best practices. Tools like [HemingwayApp](https://hemingwayapp.com/)  can help identify complicated sentences. We suggest checking content both manually and with tools. Aim for a Grade 8 reading level. Even though our audience is highly educated, everyone understands information better when it is clear and simple.

## Document Testing

Authors should the tools available to them to check document accessibility. [Visit Section508.gov for tips](https://www.section508.gov/create/). Use the built-in accessibility checker in Microsoft Office to catch problems. For Google Workspace documents, use GrackleDoc to find similar issues.

Authors should also make documents easy to follow. Use slides with one heading and one main point. These are easier to read than slides with too much content.

If we publish a document as a PDF, we will also include an editable version in Microsoft Office. This will make it easier to update and improve the document in the future.

## Legacy and Contributed Content

The repository includes older and contributed materials. These materials are useful for students, but they may not meet accessibility standards.

## Feedback

We want feedback from users, educators, and developers. If you see a problem with accessibility, please tell us. You can [report issues in our issue queue](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/issues). Your feedback helps us improve.
