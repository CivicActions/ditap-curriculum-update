# Best Practices in DITAP Delivery Facilitation

In DITAP delivery, your role is more like a facilitator of discovery than a content sharer or teacher. It goes beyond covering slides. Their success as participants, and your success as the facilitator, depends on drawing insights from their personal experiences and helping them connect the dots to the material.   
We’ve broken these best practices into three categories: Preparation, During Class, and At the End of Class. Let’s take a look at each in detail.

## Preparation:

* Understand the curriculum.  
  * Make use of the facilitator guides.   
  * Familiarize yourself with the participant materials and self-paced assignments ahead of class time.   
  * Know the flow and purpose of each module.  
* Familiarize yourself with how adults learn.  
  * Remember, DITAP learners are experienced professionals who balance their normal workload with completing this course.  
  * Incorporate their specific agency expertise to reinforce the module content.  
  * Understand that life happens; set specific actions participants can take when they need to miss a class, have missing assignments, fall behind in the course, etc. Without a clear action plan, these obstacles can become insurmountable.  
* Ensure you understand the module objectives.  
  * Ensure you can clearly explain what each virtual classroom session aims to accomplish.  
  * Determine how you can help participants connect the dots and make it relevant to their specific needs and steps in the procurement process.  
* Plan for timing and pacing.  
  * Note which sections tend to take longer for delivery and those where you can flex time.  
  * Practice delivering the course content in the proposed timeframe to determine an estimate of slide pacing and timing.  
* Set up and test your tech.  
  * Test your video conferencing platform and collaborative tools to ensure optimal performance.  
  * Have a dedicated way for participants to get help “in the moment” during class.  
  * Develop a backup plan for days when the technology fails to integrate smoothly with virtual delivery.   
* Coordinate with course moderators.  
  * Plan for one moderator per live session. This person can share the ice breaker, set up and control the breakout rooms, mark attendance, etc.  
  * Decide who will lead each section if you choose to co-facilitate.  
  * Plan how you’ll handle questions placed in a chat rather than asked verbally.  
  * Identify internal signals you’ll use to communicate with each other during class.

## During Class

* Build trust and rapport.  
  * Use icebreakers at the start of each session.  
  * Provide multiple options for participants to respond to the icebreaker.  
* Be a guide.  
  * Prompt participants to provide examples or processes that tie directly to the course content and objectives.   
  * Encourage learners to share their experiences at their agencies.  
  * Provide reflective moments. Give participants time to reflect on what they’re learning and provide opportunities for them to connect the dots.  
* User real-world examples.  
  * Tie concepts back to federal acquisition scenarios.  
  * Prompt participants to share examples from their agency.  
* Manage participation.  
  * Watch out for conversation manipulators or “the loudest voice” in the cohort. Participation is excellent, but ensure that everyone has the opportunity to have their voice heard.  
  * Allow users the flexibility to share in multiple ways, such as via chat, out loud, or by sharing images or GIFs.  
* Watch your timing.  
  * Start virtual classrooms on time.  
  * Provide a “parking lot” space for discussions or questions that are going too in-depth or too long.  
  * Build in breaks in the session. Start breaks and resume instruction on time.  
* Read the room for comprehension.  
  * Watch facial expressions and body language. When concepts are confusing or fall short, it becomes evident in participant reactions.  
  * Provide options for a “quick check”: thumbs up if you understood, thumbs down if you need more information.  
  * Create a universal signal for “I don’t understand that at all” and a way to acknowledge and respond without drawing attention to a specific user.  
* Use the cohort’s expertise.  
  * Let participants answer each other’s questions before you provide a solution.  
  * Encourage active conversation around concepts that naturally promote asking and answering questions.  
  * Incorporate “How might we” questions to reframe concepts into real-world applications for participants.  
* Keep sessions interactive.  
  * Use breakout rooms for small group activities.  
  * Use polls or emoji voting.  
  * Have users provide balance scores at the start, middle, and end of the session \- on a scale of 1-10, how are they feeling?

## At the End of Class

* Review what participants just learned.  
  * Provide a visual representation and oral recap of the content covered or session objectives.  
  * Ask participants to share one thing they learned, were surprised to learn, or a topic they’ll take away from the session.  
* Discuss upcoming work.  
  * Clearly outline the next steps for the course, including the assignments due and the tasks participants need to complete before the next session.   
* Hold space for questions.  
  * Encourage participants to reach out with any questions in an open space, such as a cohort Slack channel or via a cohort email distribution list.  
  * Promote asking questions in the open, where all cohort members can read or hear the question. This promotes visibility to the questions and answers for everyone, not just the person asking.  
  * Consider hosting bi-weekly open office hours, where participants can attend to ask questions or share their thoughts.  
* Reflect on classroom success.  
  * Note where participants were most engaged and where they appeared to disengage during the session.  
  * Determine any updates needed to better align with content framing or session objectives.   
  * Share successes and failures with other virtual classroom facilitators so the program can improve organically.
