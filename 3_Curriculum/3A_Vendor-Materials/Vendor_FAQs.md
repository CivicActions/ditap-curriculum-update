# Vendor FAQs

Q. Will pre- and post-assessments use the same questions for comparative measurement?
 <br><br>
    A. The pre- and post-assessments do not use identical questions, but they are designed to be comparable. The Pre-Assessment surfaces baseline understanding and confidence with DITAP tools and frameworks, helping facilitators anticipate learner needs and tailor early instruction. The Post-Assessment captures growth in conceptual fluency, confidence, and applied decision-making, giving participants a clear view of their progress. Baseline assessments are provided, and vendors may amend scenarios or questions, but they must ensure consistent administration across cohorts for reliable comparisons.

Q. Will module-level (formerly release-level) assessments be updated?  <br><br>
    A. End-of-module assessments are at vendor discretion, but knowledge checks and applied assignments embedded in modules are a required part of assessing conceptual fluency (See: Vendor Playbook \- Assessments \- Vendor Assessment Requirements Summary). Vendors may update or supplement these as long as they reinforce module objectives and align with the core assessment areas.

---

Q. Will there be a consistent point system (e.g., \~1000 total points, 70% passing threshold)?  <br><br>
    A. The DITAP program uses a pass/fail structure rather than a point system. This approach emphasizes meaningful growth, collaboration, and real world application, helping learners build lasting competency with less performance anxiety.

Q. How will the approach to assessments affect vendor tracking of learner performance and outcome equivalency?  <br><br>
    A. Vendors must track participation, conceptual fluency, and capstone performance using the rubrics and formative/summative assessments outlined in the Assessments section of the Vendor Playbook. While implementation details may vary, the use of consistent rubrics (See: Vendor Playbook \- Assessments \- Participation and Conceptual Fluency) and structured capstone deliverables ensures outcome equivalency across cohorts, in accordance with the Vendor Assessment Requirements Summary outlined in the Vendor Playbook.

Q. How will program duration (3 vs. 6 months) affect CLP eligibility (e.g., 60 vs. 80 CLPs)?  <br><br>
    A.Participants in the full 6-month program continue to be eligible for 80 CLPs, the same as in the previous program. For shorter or adapted versions, training providers must work with USDS to determine the appropriate CLP allocation. Clear criteria should be communicated in course materials to ensure learners understand the difference.

---

Q. Should curriculum materials be publicly available if vendor eligibility is limited?  <br><br>
     A. USDS is making the curriculum open source as it believes sharing this information with as wide an audience as possible is in everyoneâ€™s best interests. However, making the curriculum open source does not impact which vendors are authorized to deliver the training. 

---

Q. Could students access assessments or answers through GitHub, compromising instructional integrity?  <br><br>
     A. DITAP assessments are experiential in nature, focusing on applied learning, case-based assignments, and real-world decision-making rather than rote memorization; the risk of compromising instructional integrity is lower than in traditional assessment models. Knowledge checks and capstone assignments are designed to reinforce practice and application, not to be memorized. Still, vendors should protect assessment materials where possible to preserve fairness and instructional value.
