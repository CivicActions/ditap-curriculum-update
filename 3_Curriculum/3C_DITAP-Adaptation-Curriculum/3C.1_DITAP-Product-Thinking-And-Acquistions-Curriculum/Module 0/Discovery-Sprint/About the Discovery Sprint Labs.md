# DITAP Discovery Sprint Lab (Practice Sprint)

For Product Managers & CORs

## About the Discovery Sprint Labs 

Introduction & Purpose

**A. Why Are We Doing This?**

* Digital services fail when we assume too much and learn too late.
* Discovery Sprints help teams:
  * Focus on real user needs, not assumptions
  * Understand operational, policy, and technical constraints
  * Avoid waste by aligning the solution to actual mission outcomes
* This lab simulates a “lightweight discovery sprint” in a government context and can be used to gather and define requirements and scope for an upcoming acquisition.

**B. Course Connection**

This lab reinforces key concepts from earlier modules:

* **Module 1: Agile Mindset & Roles**  
  → Practice user-centered, iterative thinking in a cross-functional team
* **Module 2: Discovery & Problem Framing**  
  → Apply techniques like stakeholder interviews, journey mapping, and defining success criteria
* **Module 3: Framing Requirements**  
  → Convert discovery findings into usable inputs for a SOO/PWS or evaluation strategy
* **Module 4: Managing Delivery**  
  → Understand how good discovery work sets the foundation for performance

## Learning Objectives

* **Apply a product mindset** to early-stage problem framing  
  * Focus on the *problem*, not the solution  
* **Conduct self-directed research** to uncover user needs, policy drivers, and technical constraints  
  * Use discovery techniques such as stakeholder interviews, reviewing existing documentation, and analyzing current systems or processes.→ Learn to ask meaningful questions, identify important patterns, and make informed decisions even when information is incomplete.  
* **Identify and prioritize user needs, mission drivers, and environmental constraints**  
  * Translate raw observations into structured insights that guide design and acquisition  
*  **Capture findings in acquisition-aligned formats**  
  * Document key insights as usable inputs for a Statement of Objectives (SOO), Performance Work Statement (PWS), or evaluation criteria  
*   **Collaborate in a cross-functional team**  
    - Experience the dynamics of working with researchers, technologists, SMEs, and acquisition professionals

## Alignment to Acquisition Lifecycle

The outputs from this lab can directly support:
* **Market Research & Requirements Development**  
  (Discovery outputs feed a meaningful SOO or PWS)
* **Acquisition Strategy**  
  (Clear understanding of what outcomes matter and what constraints exist)
* **Proposal Evaluation Planning**  
  (User needs and success criteria help define what “good” looks like)
