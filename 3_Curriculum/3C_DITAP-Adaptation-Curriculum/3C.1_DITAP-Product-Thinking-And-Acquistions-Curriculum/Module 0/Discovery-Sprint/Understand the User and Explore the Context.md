# Discovery Sprint Lab \- Week 2/Day 2

## Discovery Sprint Lab \#2: Understand the User and Explore the Context 

**Lab Overview**   
In this lab, your team will map the current-state user experience for your assigned challenge. You'll take on role-based perspectives, simulate stakeholder interviews, and conduct lightweight research to understand the ESA environment from both user and system lenses. This lab helps you surface pain points, spot patterns, and generate grounded insights that will shape your future product direction.

**Scenario Setup**  
You’re part of a sprint team tasked with modernizing or improving an existing federal service in this case, the ESA Registry. Before you propose solutions, you must first understand the current process as experienced by users, staff, and technical stakeholders.

**Materials Provided:** 

* Stakeholder Interview Prompts (by role)  
* GPT Instructions for Simulated AI Interviews  
* Journey Map Template  
* List of suggested Research Topics  
* Reflection Worksheet (optional)

**Team Instructions**  
Work together to:

* Conduct a **simulated stakeholder interview** using the prompt and instructions provided.  
* Share insights from your individual interviews and consolidate common **user needs, expectations, and pain points**.  
* Complete a **self-directed research drill** to explore relevant policies, systems, or legal/technical constraints.  
* Create a **high-level As-Is Journey Map** showing the current user experience.  
* Annotate the journey with **pain points**, “**moments that matter**,” and **system-level challenges**.  
* Identify **1–2 opportunity areas** where improvements would have the most impact.

**Reflection Prompts**

* What stood out about the current experience?  
* Where do users struggle most and why?  
* How did different functional roles interpret the problem?  
* What patterns did you observe across interviews and research?  
* How could your findings shape future procurement or product decisions?
