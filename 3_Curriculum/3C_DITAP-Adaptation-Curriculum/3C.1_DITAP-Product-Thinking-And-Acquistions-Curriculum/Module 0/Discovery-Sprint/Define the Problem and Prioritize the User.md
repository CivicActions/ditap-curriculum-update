# DITAP Discovery Sprint Lab \- Week 1/Day 1

## Discovery Sprint Lab \#1: Define the Problem and Prioritize the User

**Lab Overview**   
Your team will define a clear, mission-aligned problem statement for a fictional government service challenge. The focus is on understanding the problem, not solving it yet. You’ll review user personas, surface early assumptions, and identify gaps that need further exploration.

**Scenario Setup**  
You are part of the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), which has received a directive to improve access, transparency, and integrity around the registration of Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) for individuals seeking accommodations in housing, travel, and public services. Currently, no centralized or consistent digital system exists to register ESAs or verify eligibility in real-time for landlords, airlines, or government service providers—leading to confusion, inconsistent enforcement, and rising concerns about fraud.

As members of the Office of Civil Rights digital procurement team, you’ve been asked to lead a discovery sprint in collaboration with your CIO counterparts to assess whether a centralized, user-centered ESA Registry is feasible, desirable, and implementable through a future digital service acquisition.

This discovery sprint will help your team:
* Understand the most significant barriers to ESA registration today  
* Identify the core users of the system and uncover what they need  
* Explore operational, policy, and technical constraints  
* Define measurable outcomes for success  
* Draft a Statement of Objectives (SOO) to serve as the starting point for market research and a future solicitation

Your findings will directly inform the government’s acquisition approach and lay the groundwork for a more equitable, accessible, and trustworthy ESA registration experience.

The quality of your sprint outputs will directly influence the government’s ability to buy the right solution.

**Materials Provided:** 

* Orientation to the Discovery Sprint format  
* Scenario Overview  
  Starter Problem Statement  
* 3–5 Predefined Personas

**Team Instructions**  
 Work together to complete the following:
 1. **Create a Team Charter**
    * Choose a team name  
    * Define your team’s working agreements (e.g., how you’ll collaborate, communicate, and make decisions)
2. **Draft a Clear Problem Statement**
    * Use the provided template to craft a concise, user-centered problem statement  
    * Reframe the challenge to focus on user pain points and mission alignment
3. **Identify Pain Points & Opportunities**
    * Review the personas and highlight early themes or issues that surface  
    * Document key insights about barriers, unmet needs, or inconsistencies
4. **Prioritize Personas**
    * Rank the personas in tiers:  
         * **Tier 1 (Primary Users)** – Directly affected and most critical to success  
         * **Tier 2 (Secondary Users)** – Impacted but less directly  
         * **Tier 3 (Tertiary Users)** – Peripheral stakeholders or influencers
5. **List Knowledge Gaps**
    * Capture what you **know**, what you **don’t know**, and what you’re **assuming**  
    * Generate a list of follow-up questions you’d ask users or stakeholders to validate and deepen your understanding

**Reflection Prompts**

After completing your team work, reflect as a group:
* How did your team align on the core problem?  
* What information felt missing and how might you go about filling that gap?  
* What assumptions surfaced? Which ones feel risky or unvalidated?  
* How does this approach to problem framing differ from what typically happens at your agency?
