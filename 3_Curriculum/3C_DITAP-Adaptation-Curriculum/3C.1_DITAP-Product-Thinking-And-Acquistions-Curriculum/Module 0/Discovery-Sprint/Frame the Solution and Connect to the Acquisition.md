# Discovery Sprint Lab \- Week 3/Day 3

## Discovery Sprint Lab \#3: Frame the Solution and Connect to the Acquisition

**Lab Overview**   
In this final lab, your team will translate what you’ve learned into an early-stage acquisition strategy. You’ll craft a product vision, define success, and shape a high-level Statement of Objectives (SOO) that reflects user needs and delivery readiness. The goal is to connect discovery insights to real-world procurement decisions.

**Scenario Setup**  
You’ve completed a short discovery sprint and need to advise leadership on how to move forward. They’re ready to act but need your help framing the opportunity, clarifying success, and choosing a path that supports agile delivery. Your job is to recommend an approach that reflects what you’ve learned about the problem, the users, and the environment.

### **Materials Provided**

* Discovery Summary Notes from Labs 1 & 2  
* Draft Hypothesis Statement  
* SOO Template  
* Product Vision and Metrics Worksheet  
* Presentation Template (optional)

**Team Instructions**   
Work together to create a short summary memo or slide deck that includes the following:

* **A refined problem statement:** Update your original framing based on what you’ve learned in Labs 1 and 2\.  
* **A product vision statement;** Describe the desired future state—what would success look and feel like for users?  
* **Success metrics:** Define 2–3 outcome-focused metrics that reflect meaningful impact.  
* **A draft Statement of Objectives (SOO):** Outline what the government wants to achieve, not how the vendor should do it. Keep it high-level and outcome-oriented.  
* **Your contracting strategy:** Recommend PWS or SOO and explain why. Include one evaluation method or vendor selection technique that reflects agile principles (e.g., demo, down-select, team interviews).

**Reflection Prompts**

* How did your discovery insights shape your acquisition strategy?  
* What was most challenging about moving from learning to planning?  
* What conversations would you need to have with your COR, CO, or leadership to move this forward?  
* How would this approach improve vendor engagement, delivery outcomes, or oversight?
