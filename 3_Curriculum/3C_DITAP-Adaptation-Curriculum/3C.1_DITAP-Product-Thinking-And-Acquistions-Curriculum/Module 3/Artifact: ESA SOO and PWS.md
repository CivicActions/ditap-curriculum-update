## ESA Statement of Objectives (SOO)

**Statement of Objectives (SOO)** **Agency:** National Office of Things & Stuff (NOTS)  
**Project:** Emotional Support Animal (ESA) Digital Experience Improvement  
**Date:** \[Insert Date\]

**1. Background**  
NOTS is responsible for facilitating public-facing services related to personal declarations, citizen wellness, and data-driven support structures. Citizens across the country have expressed frustration with the current process of registering Emotional Support Animals (ESAs), which is fragmented, confusing, and vulnerable to misinformation. A recent discovery sprint uncovered a lack of trust in existing platforms, inconsistent communication across channels, and accessibility barriers for individuals seeking validation and resources for their ESAs.

**2. Objectives**  
The objectives of this effort are to:

1. Improve the digital experience for citizens attempting to register Emotional Support Animals by creating a centralized, trustworthy, and user-friendly service.
2. Reduce confusion and misdirection caused by unofficial and fraudulent ESA registration websites.
3. Ensure that the registration process is equitable, accessible, and compliant with relevant federal policies.
4. Increase public trust in the ESA support service through clear, transparent, and plain language communication.
5. Enable NOTS to better collect, track, and analyze ESA-related data while protecting user privacy.

**3. Scope of work**  
The vendor shall propose a solution that meets the objectives above. The approach should:

* Be informed by continued user research and testing.
* Prioritize accessibility (Section 508 compliance), mobile responsiveness, and plain language.
* Include discovery-to-delivery service design (e.g., prototype → beta → live).
* Support integration with existing NOTS identity and data platforms, as appropriate.  
  Include a roadmap for long-term service maintenance and improvement.

**4. Constraints and considerations**

* Must comply with federal web accessibility and privacy regulations.
* No collection of unnecessary personally identifiable information (PII).
* Must be designed to accommodate individuals with limited digital literacy.
* Solution must align with U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) principles and design standards.

**5. Desired outcomes**

* A functional ESA registration platform that users find trustworthy and easy to use.
* A reduction in helpdesk inquiries and misdirected applications.
* Improved user confidence and task success when completing ESA-related tasks.
* Documentation and artifacts that support future scalability and reuse.
