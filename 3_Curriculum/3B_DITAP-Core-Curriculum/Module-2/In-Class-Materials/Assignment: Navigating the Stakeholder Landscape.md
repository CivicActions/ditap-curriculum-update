# Navigating the Stakeholder Landscape 

## **Introduction**

When it comes to digital services, success isn't just about technology. It's about people: *your stakeholders*. Some are obvious, like program owners or end users. Others might only become visible once you're deep into the work. By then, their feedback can slow things down or force major changes.

That’s why it’s so important to identify the right people early and involve them at the right time. Stakeholders influence decisions, offer key insights, and help you stay aligned with agency goals, policies, and user needs.

This activity will be introduced in class and completed on your own. You will think through who your stakeholders are, what roles they play, and how best to engage them throughout the acquisition process. With a little planning up front, you can avoid last-minute surprises and build stronger support for your approach.

Let’s get started.

Consider the following two situations:

* **Situation 1:** You’re working on a digital services procurement and need to answer the question, “Who is my customer?” That’s easy, you think. It’s the program office or the program owner \- the visionary and champion for the product or service. But wait a minute. Is that always the case? Are they the end users who will use the product or service? For instance, are they the individual entering data into a system, the citizen using your website to learn about energy efficient products, or the government team that will primarily use  this new tool? The answer to this question will drive how you approach the acquisition. End users should drive your technical and design decisions – so get them involved in the process\! This sounds simple in theory. However, it’s not so simple in execution, when you have other stakeholders – budget, acquisition policy, Chief Information Officers / Information Technology (CIO/IT), as well as vendors and contractors – who feel strongly about the design and execution of the product or service.   
* **Situation 2:** You’ve spent months putting together an acquisition plan and getting various stakeholders to review and provide feedback along the way. All of a sudden, a new stakeholder—one you hadn’t thought to include to date—provides feedback that requires you to significantly adjust your approach. Frustrated, you think, “If only I had thought to get them on board and involved earlier on, we could’ve had a better product and saved time and money.” We can probably all relate to a time (or times\!) when this has happened and the resulting frustration we felt.

So how do you plan for involving your customers and engaging all stakeholders at the right time in the right way? That’s where the stakeholder analysis assignment activity comes in\!

**Why Is Stakeholder Engagement So Critical on Digital Services Efforts?**

According to Agile theory and the TechFAR, it’s critical to bring together the “right” cross-functional team of high performers in order to take on the frequently evolving, rapid pace of digital projects. In addition, “Big A” acquisition methods advocate for broad inclusion of agency leaders, managers, acquisition policy, and oversight functions in the acquisition lifecycle. 

As a function that, in part, is responsible for reducing the risks of legal, regulatory, financial, and compliance exposure in contracting, acquisition resists the unfamiliar and uncertain. Acquisition strategies you may want to pursue in digital services may attract greater scrutiny merely because they are not common practices in the agency, even though they are legal and adhere to acquisition regulations and agency procurement policy. 

To get your stakeholders comfortable with your approaches, you should anticipate a high level of interaction between agency team members, contractors, and other stakeholders. But how do you identify who you should talk to? And, once you have identified them, how and when do you engage with them?
