**Location:** \[Insert Location or Link\]  
**Target Audience:** Federal acquisition professionals enrolled in DITAP  
**Facilitator(s):** \[Insert Facilitator Name(s)\]

## I. Overview & Objectives

In this session, learners apply market research planning techniques to Casey’s CRM project from the Cynuria case study. Building on their stakeholder analysis, they identify knowledge gaps and begin shaping a high-level plan to better understand user needs, constraints, and potential vendors.

**Learning Objectives**:
* Draft research questions based on known needs and uncertainties  
* Identify market research methods relevant to digital service acquisitions  
* Understand how stakeholder insights shape early research priorities  
* Connect research activities to downstream procurement decisions

| Note: This is an extension activity designed to deepen application of the Cynuria case. It is *not part of the original case study* but builds on Milestone 1 to help learners connect stakeholder insights to early market research planning and discovery strategy. |

## III. Session Agenda & Activities

**Sprint 4 Activity: Market Research Planning**  
**Time:** 30-45 minutes

**Instructions:**  
- Ask learners to imagine they’re supporting Casey’s team as they prepare for early market research. In small groups, they should:  
    - Identify 2–3 key open questions or uncertainties
    - List information sources (e.g., user interviews, IT inventories, RFIs)
    - Choose methods to fill gaps (e.g., industry scan, stakeholder interviews)  
- Encourage teams to tie each research idea back to a specific stakeholder concern or organizational constraint.  
- Reinforce the link between what they learn now and decisions they’ll make in Module 3

**Expected Outcomes:**
* A rough outline of a research plan addressing known gaps  
* Clarity on how discovery work will inform next steps in design

**Optional Extension Activities:**
* **Define Success:** Ask teams to write a success statement for the CRM project based on current insights  
* **Readiness Check:** Facilitate a brief discussion: *“Is this agency ready for cloud CRM?”* Use stakeholder data to explore readiness

**Next Steps/Follow-Up:**
* See FAR 10 Integration Assignment

**IV. Additional Resources/ Appendix**

* Stakeholder Map Template (Power/Interest Grid)  
* Sample Market Research Plan Framework  
* Cynuria Case Study – Narrative and Milestone Versions
