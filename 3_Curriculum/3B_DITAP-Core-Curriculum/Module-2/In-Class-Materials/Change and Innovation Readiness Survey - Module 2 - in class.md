# Change and Innovation Readiness Survey

## Instructions

Reflect on your agency by reading the statements below and providing a numerical rating of your agency’s readiness for change on a scale of 1-5. Then, respond to the short-answer questions in the Change and Innovation Readiness Survey to help you assess your agency's readiness, and think about where there might be opportunities for you to impact change and influence stakeholders.
