# Stakeholder Interests Template

This template helps you better understand your stakeholders’ interests. It helps visualize with whom you must connect and which risks to mitigate.

- Who are my stakeholders?
  - Avoid using names only; include a brief description of their function or the role they play in the acquisition process.
- What might be the stakeholders’ interests or concerns?
  - Consider role interests, like technical, program management, project management, etc.
- What will the stakeholders find challenging?
  - Consider technical functions, but be specific in what’s causing the challenge.
- What’s the stakeholders’ contribution to acquiring a digital service?
  - What role do stakeholders play in the acquisition process? Do they hold the purse strings? Are they decision-makers or influencers?
