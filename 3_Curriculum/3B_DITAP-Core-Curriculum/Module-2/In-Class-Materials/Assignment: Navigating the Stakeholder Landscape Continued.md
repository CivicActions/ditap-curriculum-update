# Navigating the Stakeholder Landscape Cont'd

### So, Is This Really That Different From How You’ve Engaged Stakeholders Before?

In some ways, no. You’ll likely see many of the same roles—program owners, legal, contracting, policy. But digital services work demands a more intentional and flexible approach to stakeholder engagement.

Why? Because you’re often introducing new methods, tools, or expectations that can feel unfamiliar—or even risky—to others. You’re aiming for faster delivery, more collaboration, and outcomes rooted in user needs. That changes when, how, and with whom you engage.

### Why the Landscape Looks Different

The Stakeholder Landscape Map you’ll explore in this activity offers a big-picture view of the many individuals and groups who may shape your acquisition.

It’s not a checklist—it’s a prompt to think strategically about:

* Who can influence or impact your success
* What role(s) they play
* When and how to bring them in

Just remember: people don’t fit neatly into one category. For example, your Head of Contracting Activity (HCA) might be a key acquisition leader, provide oversight, and serve as an internal influencer—all at once.

### **Why Tailored Engagement Matters**

You won’t engage a compliance officer the same way you would a product owner or a community outreach lead. Each stakeholder has different priorities, power, and concerns.

That’s why thoughtful engagement—early and tailored to their role—is key. It builds trust, reduces friction, and helps your team avoid unnecessary roadblocks later on.

### **Zooming Out: Who’s in the Landscape?**

Here’s a quick look at the six main stakeholder groups you might encounter in a digital services acquisition:

* **Digital Services Acquisition Partnership:** Your core team—program, product, and procurement partners making it all work.  
* **Served Communities and Customers:** End users, citizens, and front-line staff. Their needs shape the solution.
* **Acquisition Stakeholders:** Contracting officers, legal, policy advisors—those who help execute and manage the procurement.
* **Partners, Suppliers, and Co-Creators:** Vendors and external collaborators who contribute ideas and expertise.
* **Oversight and Governance:** Legal, Office of General Counsel (OGC), Inspector General (IG), and other bodies ensuring compliance and regulatory alignment.
* **Advocates and Influencers:** Senior champions who can open doors, build buy-in, and smooth the path forward.

### **Reflection Prompt**

Think about a recent or upcoming digital services acquisition you’re working on.

* Who are three stakeholders you haven’t traditionally engaged early, but probably should?  
* What would be the benefit of involving them sooner?
