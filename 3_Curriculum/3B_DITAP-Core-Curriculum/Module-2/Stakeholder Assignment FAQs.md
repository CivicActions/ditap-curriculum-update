# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1: How do I select the right stakeholders for this assignment?**  
Choose individuals within your agency who have significant influence over digital services, procurement, or operations—especially those you don’t normally interact with. Ideal stakeholders might include CIOs, CAOs, HCAs, SPEs, CFOs, or policy leads. Aim for those whose decisions impact digital transformation efforts.

**Q2: What if I already know who I want to interview?**  
That’s fine—as long as they meet the assignment criteria: influential, within your agency, not a peer or frequent collaborator, and not currently enrolled in the DITAP program. Be sure to explain why they’re a relevant and strategic choice.

**Q3: Can I interview more than two stakeholders?**  
Yes. While the requirement is to complete at least two interviews, participants are encouraged to interview up to four stakeholders. More conversations often lead to a richer understanding of your agency’s landscape.

**Q4: What should I include in my interview summary?**  
Your summary should capture the stakeholder’s insights about innovation, digital services, and procurement in your agency. Include what you learned about their priorities, perspectives, and any challenges or opportunities they raised. Reflections and next steps are also valuable.

**Q5: Do I need to follow up after the interview?**
Yes. Following up is considered best practice—it shows professionalism and helps build relationships. Use the follow-up to thank them, share any takeaways, and keep the door open for future collaboration.

**Q6: What if a stakeholder is unavailable or declines to participate?**  
If a stakeholder is unavailable, select someone else within your agency who meets the same general criteria. Be flexible, but intentional in finding someone who can offer insight into your agency’s systems and decision-making.

**Q7: Are there any questions I should avoid during the interview?**  
Avoid overly personal, irrelevant, or closed-ended questions. Focus on open-ended prompts about their work, priorities, pain points, and views on innovation and change. Stay curious, professional, and respectful of their time.

**Q8: How should I prepare for the interviews?**  
Research your stakeholder’s role and any related digital or procurement initiatives in your agency. Use the interview guide to draft thoughtful questions. Practice your introduction and clarify your goals for the conversation in advance.

**Q9: Can I ask the stakeholder for feedback on how I conducted the interview?**  
You can—especially if you’re aiming to build rapport or improve your communication skills. But keep the focus on their insights, not on evaluating your performance. If you ask for feedback, do so briefly at the end of the conversation.

**Q10: How will I know if my assignment is approved?**  
You’ll receive confirmation through the learning portal or directly from your facilitator. If anything is missing or needs revision, your facilitator will follow up with clear guidance.

**Q11: Can I conduct interviews virtually or asynchronously (e.g., by email)?**  
Interviews should ideally be conducted live—via phone, video call, or in-person—to allow for dynamic conversation and follow-up questions. Email can be used if scheduling is a barrier, but it may limit the depth and spontaneity of the dialogue.

**Q12: What if I learn something sensitive or surprising during the interview?**  
Respect confidentiality. Use your summary to reflect on themes and insights, but avoid including identifying details unless they were shared in a public or professional context. When in doubt, check with your facilitator.
