# Module 4 Outline: Managing Digital Delivery 

This module focuses on effective agile product delivery in federal environments by clarifying the roles of the Project Manager (PM), Product Owner (PO), and Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR). It emphasizes shifting from a compliance-driven mindset to a collaborative, mission-focused approach, aligning agile rituals with federal oversight. Participants learn to identify and respond to common sprint delivery issues, distinguish between agile delivery metrics and traditional contract oversight metrics, and support continuous improvement through agile practices and performance documentation. Through a sprint report analysis activity using the ESA Registry Project, learners apply concepts in a practical context, with an optional retrospective encouraging reflection and future improvement.

## Module Objectives:

* Describe the roles of the PM, PO, and COR in agile product delivery  
* Identify common sprint delivery issues and determine appropriate responses  
* Differentiate between contract oversight metrics and agile delivery metrics  
* Support continuous improvement and compliance through agile rituals and performance documentation  
* Foster a collaborative, mission-focused delivery environment after contract award
