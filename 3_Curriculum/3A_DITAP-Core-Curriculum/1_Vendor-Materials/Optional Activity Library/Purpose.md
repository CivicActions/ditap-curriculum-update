# Optional Activity Library

The following materials provide a library of optional activities that facilitators can use to enrich live sessions. The activities included here were suggested during course design and align with the learning objectives and key topics for each module. While some are fully developed and ready to use, others are provided at the idea stage and may require adaptation or additional preparation.

The purpose of this library is to give facilitators flexibility and choice. You can draw from these activities to:

- Reinforce or extend key concepts introduced in the self-paced modules.  
- Encourage discussion, reflection, and application of ideas to real-world contexts.  
- Provide variety in session formats and learner engagement strategies.  

Feel free to modify, combine, or build on these activities to best suit your learners and context.
