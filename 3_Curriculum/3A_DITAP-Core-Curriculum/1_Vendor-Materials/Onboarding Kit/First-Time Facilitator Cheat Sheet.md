# DITAP First-Time Facilitator Cheat Sheet

**Mindset**

* **You’re a guide, not the guru** — the goal is to help participants learn how they can apply the DITAP curriculum in their procurement processes, not just hear it from you.  
* **Make it interactive** — DITAP works best when participants share their experiences and help each other relate the content to their agencies.  
* **Stay flexible** — discussions may take longer than planned; be ready to adapt and to know when to move the conversation to a parking lot or circle back area. 

## Top 5 Facilitation Moves

1. **Ask open-ended, real-world questions**:  
   * “How would this work in your agency?”  
   * “What’s a challenge you’ve faced with this?”  
   * What solutions could you implement at your agency?  
2. **Pull in quieter voices**:  
   * “We haven’t heard from you yet, Alex — what’s your take?”  
3. **Acknowledge expertise**:  
   * “That’s a great point, and I think others could benefit from hearing how you did that.”  
4. **Summarize & connect**:  
   * “So we’ve heard two different proposals — notice how both incorporate human-centered design.”  
5. **Keep the conversations moving**:  
   * “Let’s capture that in the parking lot and circle back if we have time.”  
   * “That’s a great question\! Can you type that in our cohort chat so everyone can reflect and answer?”

## Sample Collaboration Questions

* “What stood out to you in this section?”  
* “How might this look different in your agency?”  
* “What’s one risk you’d need to manage?”  
* “If you were explaining this to a colleague, how would you put it?”

## Facilitation Tips

* **Open strong**: welcome and ice breaker → recap of previous session → session objectives (5–10 min)  
* **Take breaks** every 60 minutes at a minimum, more frequently as needed.   
* **Maintain time limits**; start and end on time.  
* **Leave a 5-minute buffer** before the session closes for wrap-up and Q\&A.

## Interactive Suggestions

If discussion lags or tech fails, try:

* **Rapid poll**: “Thumbs up/down — have you seen this in your agency?”  
* **Mini breakouts**: 5 min in pairs → 1 takeaway each.  
* **Quick chat storm**: “Type in the chat one word you associate with… \[topic\].”

## End-of-Session Steps

1. **Ask**: “What’s one insight you’re taking away?”  
2. **Recap** 2–3 key points.  
3. **Preview** next session and assignment deadlines.  
4. **Thank** the group — name a specific thing they did well today.
